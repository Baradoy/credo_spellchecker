# CredoSpellchecker

Spell checking for [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo)

This is a fairly simple spell checker which uses wordlists from http://app.aspell.net.

## Installation

This is not ready for you to use yet. Check back later when I have made more progress.

### Case Insensitivity

The spell checker works by breaking down PascalCase and snake_case into downcased words that are checked individually.
